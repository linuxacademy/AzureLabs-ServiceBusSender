# AzureLabs-ServiceBusSender

This ASP.NET MVC application is part of a Hands-On Azure Lab designed to demonstrate how Service Bus queues and topics are managed. Specifically, this Web App works in conjunction with Azure Functions to resize uploaded photos, and to either move those uploaded photos (if saved) or delete them.

Note that while you are free to download this application and use it however you like, it is not designed, nor is it supported, for independent use. It exists in a public GitHub repo to allow its content to be sent directly to an Azure Web App that is provisioned from an ARM template.
